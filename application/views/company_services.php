                We work with you to design and build your event from the ground up. Having our own in-house team of event specialists allows us to work in
                partnership with our clients, offering our experience and guidance at each and every stage. Our enthusiasm for creating events of the

                <h2>FILM & VIDEO</h2>
                The use of film and video is an essential part of any event. High impact on-screen content enables our clients to communicate
                their message in the most powerful way. Our style is rather simple to explain, we create wedding films which are emotive and beautiful.
                Our focus is on storytelling through quaint imagery and fine composition of video, always remaining unnoticed to capture those really natural
                and beautiful moments – In essence, we film from a guest’s perspective.  It’s your wedding day, not a birthday production,
                so we actively make sure that throughout the day we’ll blend with the guests, with camera gear which is no bigger than that of a photographer.
                Strictly no clunky tripods and shoulder mounted cameras allowed, yet the quality of the footage I capture is superbly cinematic.
